# Assignment 3 – Action Plan

### Debugging & Learning Strategy

When I encounter coding concepts that feel confusing or overwhelming, I plan to use the following approach going forward:

- First step when confused:
  I will re-read the lecture slides and starter code, then isolate the problem by testing one small change at a time instead of trying to fix everything at once.

- Time limit before asking for help:  
  If I am stuck for more than *30–45 minutes, I will reach out for help instead of avoiding the task. This may include asking a classmate, posting a question, or attending office hours.

- Resources that help me most:  
  I learn best from *examples and visuals, so I will use resources like MDN documentation, short YouTube tutorials, and working sample code to understand concepts.

- Debugging process: 
  I will use browser developer tools (console errors, console.log) and validators earlier in the process to catch mistakes before they build up.

- Managing avoidance: 
  When I notice myself avoiding a task, I will break it into smaller steps and aim to complete just one piece, rather than postponing the entire assignment.

This plan is meant to help me stay engaged and confident when working through challenging coding concepts in future assignments.
